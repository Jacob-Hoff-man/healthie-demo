# Demo - TypeScript Kanban Board React Client

### Problem Description

If you are a React coder, use React (preferably Typescript). Otherwise, code in the JS framework of your
choice.

Make a frontend-only todo list app.
- It has three vertical lists. Todo, Doing, and Done
- Items are created via a form (they can be stored in browser state, no need to have a backend)
- Items are draggable from one list to another
- Items can be reordered within a list
- When you drag an item into the Done list, confetti explodes on the screen! Or something else interesting. You can use a package for this.
- Overall the app has a usable design with a unique color palette. You are free to make whatever

UI and UX decisions you want to make it usable. Don't worry, we aren't looking for a groundbreaking innovative design. Just lay things out decently and add some colors.
- Using Typescript will get you bonus points.

### Problem Solution
